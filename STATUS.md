We are applying for the three badges: Available, Functional, Reusable badges. We believe that our artifact is worthy of the badges for the three reasons:
* The artifact is available on the public repository: https://github.com/kupl/HOMI_public
* We provided all the benchmarks used in the evaluation and useful script for reproducing the main experimental results of the paper.
* We provided detailed instructions to perform our tool, Homi, for testing arbitrary open-source C programs. We believe that other researchers are able to reuse our tool easily in their own research.
